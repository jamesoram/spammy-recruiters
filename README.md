# Spammy Recruiters lists
A growing list of spammy companies that provide outsourcing/recruitment services. Particularly relevant to tech startups based in London, UK. Each of the companies below are doing mass emails, have automatic email follow ups when you do not reply (sometimes up to 5-6 emails) and either do not have "unsubscribe" links or the links don't work.

The lists below are formatted for Gmail for an easy copy-paste ðŸ‘Œ Note that there is a limit to how long the `from` criteria can be, so you have to create multiple filters â€” I have splitted the criteria into batches to make it easier.

### How to create filters in Gmail

Click on the Search omnibox and copy paste each batch of emails into the `From` field, like so:

Then click on `Create filter` and choose what to do with the emails that match the criteria â€” either delete or mark as spam.

### Advice to recruiters / outsourcing agencies

- Research the company before sending an email to advertise your services. Very often you'll see a notice saying "We do not work with recruitment / outsourcing agencies" on job posts; sometimes the technologies you're talking about are not used at all in that company, etc.
- Do not set up more than 1 automatic email to follow up; chances are very low you'll get a response if someone hasn't replied to your first 2 emails.
- Have a working "unsubscribe me" link if people do not want to hear from you after they have read your first email. Check if this link works regularly.
- If someone says they're not interested â€” then move on, do not try to convince them by asking for their past experience or sending more emails with additional materials.
- Talk to your colleagues about the points above. If one person is mass emailing and spamming people, then the Spam rating for your domain will go down and chances are that everyone's emails will start going straight to people's Spam folder.
- Spam is a crime in the UK and you can be reported: https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/online/spam-emails/

If you follow the steps above, it's less likely your emails will be marked as "Spam" or your company end up listed here.
